# IgnoreOnIsolate is an issue: when someone isolates rescue.target,
# tradition expects that we shut down all but the main console.

[Service]
# The '-o' option value tells agetty to replace 'login' arguments with an
# option to preserve environment (-p), followed by '--' for safety, and then
# the entered username.
